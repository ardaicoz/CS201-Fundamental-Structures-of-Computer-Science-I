# CS201-Fundamental-Structures-of-Computer-Science-I
My solutions for homeworks for Bilkent University's CS201 - Fundamental Structures of Computer Science 1 course - Fall 2020  
  
Homework 1:  
In this homework, you will implement a flight reservation system for an airline company, which
operates multiple flights. Each flight has a unique flight number and is operated with an aircraft
that may have a different seating plan. According to its type, an aircraft has a specified number
of rows and number of seats in each row. (Although these numbers may change from one
aircraft type to another, the number of seats is the same for every row in the same aircraft.) You
will use dynamically allocated arrays for this purpose.  
  
Homework 2:  
In this homework, you will merge two sorted integer arrays. That is, given two sorted integer arrays arr1 and arr2 of size N, the problem is to create and return a third sorted array arr3 with the items of arr1 and arr2. It will have size 2N. Assume that sorting is done in ascending order of the integer items.  
Two alternative algorithms that solve this problem are given below in lay terms. Each algorithm has a different time complexity. The goal of this homework is to evaluate the growth rates of both algorithms using different inputs.  
  
Homework 3:  
In this homework, you will implement a library system by using linked lists. The library system stores information about students and books. The students will be able to check out books from the library and will be able to return them to the library. For each student, the system stores an id, name, and a list of books that she/he checked out. Each book is represented by its id, title, and year.  
  
Homework 4:  
In this homework, you will work on an extended version of the HPAir problem that we studied in the class, which is also explained in Section 6.4 in your text book (Carrano's book, 6'th edition). In this assignment, we will provide you with a directed fight graph that shows the connections between cities. A connection between two cities consists of a "flight id" and a "cost". By using this flight graph, your program must find all possible paths (sequences of flights) between the given departure and destination cities. It also should find the least cost path among all paths.
